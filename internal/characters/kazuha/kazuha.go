//Upon triggering a Swirl reaction, Kaedehara Kazuha will grant all party members a 0.04%
//Elemental DMG Bonus to the element absorbed by Swirl for every point of Elemental Mastery
//he has for 8s. Bonuses for different elements obtained through this method can co-exist.
//
//this ignores any EM he gets from Sucrose A4, which is: When Astable Anemohypostasis Creation
//- 6308 or Forbidden Creation - Isomer 75 / Type II hits an opponent, increases all party
//members' (excluding Sucrose) Elemental Mastery by an amount equal to 20% of Sucrose's
//Elemental Mastery for 8s.
//
//he still benefits from sucrose em but just cannot share it
